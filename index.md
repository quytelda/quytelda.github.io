# About Me

Hello, my name is Quytelda Kahja.  I am an open-source developer living in the bay area of California.  I am also a student at the University of Illinois College of Engineering (UIUC), where I will graduate in May of 2018.  I am involved in several open-source software projects including [The Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org), [FOCS](https://quytelda.github.io/focs), and [Babel](https://github.com/quytelda/babel).

In my free time I enjoy programming, archery, exploring, creative writing, and artificial language construction.
