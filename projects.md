# Software Projects
I have been programming as a hobby and career for over a decade, and during that time I have started more than a few projects, most of which are open source.  Here are some of the highlights; to see more, visit my GitHub page at <https://github.com/quytelda>.

## FOCS (libfocs)
FOCS is a data structure library implemented in C, designed to provide common data structures to C programs. Additionally, FOCS aims to provide a functional programming bent to these data structures providing common functional utilities like `map` and `foldr/foldl` that can be used with any of these data structures.

## Babel
Babel is a small utility written in Haskell that generates random sequences based on a context free grammar (CFG).  The software allows you to build a context free grammar using the familiar rule-based syntax (e.g. `S -> a | b | c`), then generate strings from it.  Babel can be used as a word generator or - with cryptographically secure random number generation support - a password generator.

## Kernel Theme for Jekyll (jekyll-theme-kernel)
Jekyll is a static site generator most notable for it's integration with GitHub and extensive theming support.  The Kernel Theme is a simple minimalist Jekyll theme inspired by <https://www.kernel.org>.  In fact, this website uses the Kernel Theme.  You can also use the Kernel Theme for your website using the Ruby gem `jekyll-theme-kernel` or by using [GitHub's remote themes plugin](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages).
